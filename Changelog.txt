3.2
- Added new CoverArt config which allows you to manually match songs with cover arts. Instructions how to use it are included in the file, works in similar way as ExternalMusicPaths config
- Added new tab in the settings app, which allows you to look through your playlist, play track you want or copy it's display name to clipboard (to help with Cover Art setup)
- Additionally, the above comes with a Queue function, allowing you to manually queue up tracks to play next. Might be useful if you want to play some specific music for the race, or a video. Also comes with a Queue tab where you can remove songs from the queue or change their order.
- Animated icon is now disabled by default to allow Cover Arts to be default visible.

3.1
- Added tags which allow you to disable specific music tracks depending on production year of the car.
- Added new system which allows you to add cover-art for music, with 2 search modes, more strict (full match of the track names) or less strict (partial match).

3.0
- Added new Tags system, allowing you to fine tune which music tracks play when. The system is going to be expanded with user suggestions. Currently allows to specify if a song should play only during the day, night, rain, dry, as well as in race sessions, allows to set filters for min/max position and min/max race progress.
- Applied a bandaid that should prevent all cases of 2 (or more) tracks playing at once - currently playing track will be forced to be skipped to end before overwriting it with another.

2.2
- Now Playing widget will hide itself if there's no music playing, or if the track is ending, for a cleaner transition to new track.
- Caution flag volume will kick in faster.
- Added a toggle for the anti-repetition mechanic, and turned it off by default to reduce confusion.

2.1
- Fixed replay music behaviour. Again... 
- Situational music fading is no longer active in replays.
Hopefully this is the last time I need to fix replays.
- Added checks for pitting and offline cars to Opponent Proximity check. Should properly ignore these cars now.

2.0.4
- Reworked proximity volume distance checks to be way more reliable. Old implementation was giving really weird results with changing directions.

2.0.3
- Proximity Volume now uses your average speed instead of current, for more consistent results.
- In online, music volume will now slowly fade away towards the race start countdown, instead of doing it suddenly 10 seconds before start.
- Disabled broken finish music switch in replays.

2.0.2
- Fixed idle music outside of pits option not working,
- Fixed fade in/out speeds being broken with 100% AC Master volume,

2.0.1
oops, forgot to delete placeholders

2.0
A LOT OF THINGS HAVE CHANGED. FRESH INSTALL IS VERY RECOMMENDED.

- Complete rework of volume effects. Now instead of each effect fighting for which gets the lowest volume, they stack up. This means that for example, driving slow near opponents, will give you lower music volume than driving fast near opponents,
- Intensity level has been removed, to simplify the process of including music to the mod,
- LowIntensity and HighIntensity playlists are now replaced with a new, Race playlist,
- Waiting folder got renamed to Idle,
- FinishLose folder got renamed to Finish. It is no longer necessary to add both Finish and FinishPodium. If FinishPodium is empty, it will always pick Finish folder music instead.
- Added new playlist - Other,
- From now on, the mod won't fail if you leave some folders empty. The only folder that you NEED to fill with music, is the Other folder. Everything else is optional,
- Options menu now reacts to which folders have been left empty, and doesn't show toggle options for those in Sessions tab,
- Replaced Now Playing widget font with OPTIEdgarBold,
- Now Plalying widget now only shows for the first 10 seconds of the track by default
- Track switch on crashing out has been turned off by default
- Toggling music on and off properly saves between sessions now.

If you find any bugs/problems with this release, please report them to me in the mod discussion thread on Overtake.gg, or create an issue ticket on GitHub.
And remember, for everything to work as intended, fresh install is very recommended. A lot of defaults have changed, some options got removed or shifted around.

1.3.1
- Some bugfixes for new features added in 1.3

1.3
- App now tracks how many times each of the tracks was played, storing the filenames. When picking the next song, it's comparing the playbacks amount between that one, and the one after it. If the one after it was played less, the track is skipped for the next one... HOWEVER if the one AFTER that has even less playbacks, it will choose that one... That goes up to 10 songs, so practically, this achieves 2 things. 1st, when you add new tracks to your playlists, they will be prioritized. 2nd, if you put some songs in multiple playlists, that will make them less likely to repeat more often than anything else!
- Replaced a single Minimum Volume slider with 4 of them, allowing you to adjust minimum volume for caution flags, proximity, speed and pause, separately.

1.2
- Fixed rare case that would prevent tracks from switching early and make you stuck with no music for a while. (Not a bug with my app, but i've set up a workaround)
- Added new options for Now Playing widget: Animated icon (Default Enabled) and Fadeout after X seconds (Time is configurable, Default Disabled)
- Switched font from default to Poppins-Medium for much better text readability.

1.1
- Reworked Crash effect. It now kicks in to full volume fadeout if you crash into standing still. Also skips the track to the next one. Small taps/scratches will still drop the volume slightly.
- Fixed music switching non-stop in pits when idle playlist is disabled.
- Added new option to disable waiting/idle music when you stop moving outside of pits
- Added new option to toggle the new track skip behaviour on crashing.

1.0
- Speed based volume peak is now calculated based on (AverageSpeed+TopSpeed)/2 instead of AverageSpeed*1.25 for faster callibration
- Added new on-screen widget showing you currently played track
- Session switch volume fadeout is now less violent
- Podium music won't play if you finish last but in Top 3.

0.9.1
- Added new tab in Settings which shows you a few important values like top speed, average speed and intensity level.
- Moved Top25% Victory Music toggle from Sessions to Behaviour tab
- Disabled session switch for replays to fix music being skipped when rewinding back.

0.9
- Redesigned Settings UI app.
- Added keybinding for a few actions, like increasing/decreasing volume, skipping track and enabling/disabling music entirely
- Added new file in Music folder, that allows you to specify external paths to files anywhere in your filesystem, so you don't need to copy music files into AC folder.

0.8.1
- I forgot to revert something i've tried and wasn't happy about, oops.

0.8
- Waiting/Idle music is now kicked in as soon as you're in pit stop area, even if you are moving,
- Waiting/Idle music now always plays at maximum volume,
- Intensity Level now has 2 new variables that affect it. Average Speed and Top Speed. This makes it so fast races will play high intensity music much earlier than slow races. Slow race might never get into High Intensity if you're not close to the top of the pack. Average Speed scales between 100 and 250 km/h, and Top Speed scales between 150 and 300 km/h,
- Intensity level is now boosted when you're near the top of the pack, starting with position 5 and getting more significant up to position 1 where intensity is forced to be 100%,
- Only use "doing good" volume boosters in races instead of everywhere,
- Music now switches to next track on any kind of session change or restart, even if playlist doesn't change,
- Start music sequence is back and better than ever. 10 seconds before green light all music will fade away, The moment green lits up, music kicks in at full volume, and stays there for 10 seconds before adjusting to the environment,
- Finish music now plays only once after finishing the race instead of looping until you quit or restart,
- Proximity detection now ignores cars in pits.

0.7.1
- Re-enabled position based features for online mode when Custom Shaders Patch is at least at version 0.2.1 Preview56 where Lua calls for positions online got fixed. Thanks x4fab/Ilja :)
- Enabled LuaPreprocessor for extra optimisations.

0.7
- Added new volume fadeout event - crashing. Volume drops when you hit something, be it another car or a wall, and severity of the crash defines how badly the volume is gonna drop. Took a few bits of code from Tunnel Vision filter from CSP to calculate severity of the hit,
- Turned track picking from random to shuffled sequential to deal with repetition for good without hacky solutions,
- App no longer crashes when you drop only one track into the folder. You still need to have at least one though,
- Re-organised the settings menu to show all the more basic settings at the top and advanced ones below them,
- Replaced placeholder silence files with voice messages telling you that you forgot about something ;).

0.6.1
- Fixed replay music instantly fading out in some circumstances.
- Reduced range of fade speed options as too high causes problems.
- When fade speed option is set to max, completely disables fades and cuts straight to desired values.

0.6 - Last update before proper release
- Added more detailed descriptions to some options
- Added option to adjust High Intensity threshold.
- Added option to turn off Idle music
- Added option to turn off Finish music
- Added playlist fallback for Other session types, using mix of all the other enabled playlists.
