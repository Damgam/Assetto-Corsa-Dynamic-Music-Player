In this folder you can see multiple folders called by the situations in which they play.

Important notes. 
- You can leave folders empty, except one, the 'Other' folder!
- Any empty folder will play music from the 'Other folder!
- Any folder with music included will ignore music from the 'Other' folder.
- If you add Finish music, make sure you add both Finish and FinishPodium. They can be the same files, but they should both be filled if you want Finish music.

My recommendation would be to put driving music into the Other folder and pitstop music into Idle folder, unless you want to go more specific into the categories.

If you want to get fancy, you can play around the ExternalMusicPaths.lua, there are instructions included in that file. Try not to break it though, that will brick the entire Music app.
