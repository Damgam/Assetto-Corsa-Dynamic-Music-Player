Music Player that reacts to what's happening on the track, controlling music playlists and volume.

Download: https://github.com/Damgam/Assetto-Corsa-Dynamic-Music-Player/releases

Install: Drop the DynamicMusicPlayer folder into assettocorsa\apps\lua\

Features:
- Fully automated playlist creation, just drag and drop your audio files to folders,
- 3 "Intensity" levels for race music,
- 2 Levels of race finish music, one for podium finish and one for the rest,
- Dedicated playlist for replays,
- Dynamic volume adjustments, reducing volume of the music when you're driving slow, have opponents nearby (only works in races right now, doesn't work in Practice and Qualifying), and when yellow and blue flags pop up,
- Configurability (Currently only by editing files, dedicated ingame config app coming sometime soon).

Todo:
- Ingame config app,
- Bugfixing,
- Possible extra features if I come up with ideas for such.

Known Issues:
- Playback can bug out when you restart the race without quitting to desktop, or when you jump between replay and live game.
- App does not respect ingame volume sliders, not even the Master one. (There's no slider for music). Option to adjust volume will come with an app, until then you can adjust volume in the lua file.
