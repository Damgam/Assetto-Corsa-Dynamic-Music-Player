Dynamic Music Player for Assetto Corsa! REQUIRES CUSTOM SHADERS PATCH 0.2.0+!
Older versions of CSP may work but I don't guarantee it. Some features are only fully enabled online in Custom Shaders Patch 0.2.2 and above due to a bug in previous versions.

Music Player that reacts to what's happening on the track, controlling music playlists and volume.

MUSIC IS NOT INCLUDED WITH THE APP, FILL IT WITH YOUR OWN FILES. MP3 AND OGG CONFIRMED TO WORK, WHATEVER ELSE IS SUPPORTED BY ASSETTO CORSA CSP WILL ALSO WORK.

Install: Drop the DynamicMusicPlayer folder into assettocorsa\apps\lua\
Music Install: Drop your music files into assettocorsa\apps\lua\DynamicMusicPlayer\Music\ folders

Features:
- Fully automated playlist creation, just drag and drop your audio files to folders,
- Dedicated playlist for idle, practice, qualification, race, finish and replay sessions,
- 2 Levels of race finish music, one for podium finish and one for the rest,
- Dynamic volume adjustments, reducing volume of the music when you're driving slow, crashing, have opponents nearby or when yellow and blue flags pop up,
- Configurability via ingame Settings app. You can make it as complex or as simple as you like.

Todo:
- Bugfixing,
- Possible extra features if I come up with ideas for such.

Known Issues:
- Finish music will often be wrong in Online. It will work, but it will use bugged position to determine if it should play podium music or lose music. Assetto Corsa bug, i can't do anything about it.
